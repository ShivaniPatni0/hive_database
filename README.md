# hive_database

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In that project ,I have used hive database(Local) for store values and modify them using hive.
- Using add floating button you can add note.
- You can delete it note.
- Reset note description and title.

- Packages you need :
    - hive
    - hive_flutter
    - build_runner
   - hive_generator
   - path_provider
-  After you need run command for create model for hive
command :  flutter packages pub build_runner build
- for avoid extra code and listan value real time extend the hiveobject to that class and run command "flutter packages pub run build_runner build" after you can save it value.
